# BoredApp
A demo app meant to showcase my Flutter knowledge. It fetches activities from an API and uses lazy lists to show them.

Project was created using Flutter 3.19.6.

## Features I've worked on:

## Challenges
The main challenge of this app was using the [BoredAPI](https://www.boredapi.com/) to get data, which has a few drawbacks. One of them is the issue of getting duplicate activities because you can only fetch one at a time. If you're curious, dive into the code to see my approach to tackling this problem.

Another cool feature of this app is the fancy filters bottom sheet. It doesn't provide the best UX, but it shows a pretty nice custom bottom sheet. 

## How to run
I suggest using [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation) to run the app using Flutter 3.19.6 for the best experience.

## Can't build the project?

If you don't have the environment to run the code, here is a video and some screenshots of what it looks like:
